Classes
    - a "blueprint" for an object
    In JS Classes can have two things:
        - methods and attributes but JS calls them properties and functions
        What special functions would be called if I wanted to make an object?
        - constructor () 
        example: new Object ()
        when I say new Object it calls the constructor for that class. 

Object Literals
    - literally an object
    object literals have {} classes are also defined with {}

.this
    - in class refers to class itself
    - Arrow functions technical: no scope
        "this: where defined not used"

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
a) Is a (in JS extends)
b) Has a (propreties)
c) or none

REACT
    Component Model has two things:
        - everything is a component
        - components take care of themselves
    Components are internally using fetch, took care of itself.
        - fetch data, processed date, and returned it.

    What functions in React usually returns?
    render()

JSX
    what does it stands for? JavaScript XML

    It has 3 rules: (these are XML rules)
        1) one root element ("wrapping")
        2) expressions only / no statements
        3) everything must CLOSE!

Express
    - route
        - Method: CRUD -> HTTP Method (Create, React, U, Delete)
          what is the HTTP that matches to CRUD?
            C: POST
            R: GET
            U: PATCH
            D: DELETE 

        - Path: Request parameter /____/___/:value
          what property requests parameters?
          req.params

        - Response: res.___()
                    res.___() 
                    
                    so far we have only used two res, what are those two?
                        - res.send() --> there always has to be a response!
                        - res.json() 

Node + Command-Line tools
    Commands
        cd - change directory
        mkdir - make directory
        node - "runs a JS file"
        npm - Node Package Manager
        npx - Node Package Runner
        npm init - initializes a node project, it also creates a file package.json
                keeps tracks of dependencies and packages
            package-lock.json: protects you
        npx create-react-app: creates a react app
        npm install ___ : looks for a package to install, if doing npm install by itself it looks for
                        the packages that you don't have and installs them for you
                    But how does it know what to look for to install?
                    it will look inside your package-lock.json and folders. If you are calling it and don't have it installed
                    it will get it for you
        

the arrow function has its own this?
No

A route is composed of a path and response?
False - is composed of THREE things. Path, Response and Method



App.use - for middleware
